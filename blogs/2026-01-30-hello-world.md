I want this site to be a stand-in for my GitHub profile, without doing any fancy stuff.
So: no JavaScript, no API calls, no frameworks.

The tradeoff: anything that looks like “latest repos” will be **manual** (curation over automation).
That’s fine. It keeps things intentional.

```
Rules:
1) Ship pages.
2) Link the repos.
3) Write what I learned.
```

Next: add a couple real projects to [projects.html](../projects.html).
